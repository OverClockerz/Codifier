# 13. Future Development and Scalability

"Office-RPG" is built on a flexible and scalable architecture that allows for significant future growth and feature expansion. Here is a roadmap of potential developments.

1.  **Expanded Quest Types:**
    - **Soft Skill Quests:** Introduce quests focused on simulating workplace social interactions, such as resolving team conflicts, writing professional emails, or participating in mock meetings with AI-powered colleagues.
    - **Project Management Quests:** Simple quests where players have to manage a small project board, prioritize tasks, and meet a deadline.
2.  **Enhanced Social Features:**
    - **Leaderboards:** Implement global and friend-based leaderboards for various skills and overall XP to foster friendly competition.
    - **Team Projects:** Allow players to form teams and tackle larger, collaborative quests that require different skills from multiple players.
3.  **Deeper Character Customization:**
    - **Avatars:** Allow players to customize their in-game avatars.
    - **Skill Trees:** Move from a linear stat progression to a branching skill tree, allowing players to specialize in certain career paths (e.g., Frontend Developer, Backend Developer, Project Manager).

4.  **Scalable Infrastructure:**
    - As the user base grows, the backend infrastructure will be migrated from a single server to a cloud-native, microservices architecture. This involves:
      - **Load Balancing:** Distributing incoming traffic across multiple servers.
      - **Database Scaling:** Using managed database services with read replicas and sharding.
      - **Containerization:** Using Docker and Kubernetes to manage and deploy services reliably.

The modular design of the application ensures that these new features can be developed and integrated incrementally without requiring a complete overhaul of the existing system.
